For the last few years I've been addicted to true crime podcasts. I love them. I almost have to
listen to some kind of true crime podcast before I go to sleep now. Not the podcasts that narrate or commentate
on true crime stories, but the ones that have the families, friends, victims, accused, police and lawyers speaking.
Ex. Dateline, 48 Hours.

But recently I've been questioning myself and also why true crime is so popular psychologically.

Obviously it's a highly serious subject matter and shocking compared to most of our own lives.
But I've been asking myself if it's a moral form of entertainment and whether it's right to commercialize
murder and other heinous actsâ€¦ or if it's a legitimate pursuit of journalism.

Curious to know other people's thoughts.
